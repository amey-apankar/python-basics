# Beginner Python Projects

Welcome to my repository of simple Python programs!  
I'm currently learning Python, and this repo is where I post beginner-level projects as part of my coding journey.

##  What You'll Find Here

This repo contains small and fun programs written using basic Python concepts like:
- Variables and Data Types
- If-else Statements
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions
- Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples
- File handling
- Tkinter GUI (some projects)

Each file is beginner-friendly, readable, and kept simple for easy understanding.
